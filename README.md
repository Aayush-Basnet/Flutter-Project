## 2. ListBook
The "ListBook" app is a simple task management application built using Flutter. It allows users to create a list of tasks or items that they need to remember or complete. The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing the list.

Here's a brief description of the app's features:

Add and Display Items: Users can add new items to the list by tapping on the floating action button (the "+" icon). The entered items are displayed in a scrollable list view.

Delete Items: Each item in the list can be deleted by swiping it horizontally from right to left. A delete icon is revealed, and upon confirmation, the item is removed from the list.

Visual Enhancements: The app features a visually appealing interface. It includes an app bar at the top with a title, account for profile, and a colorful floating action button.

Overall, the "ListBook" app provides a convenient way to keep track of tasks or items that need to be remembered or completed. It offers basic functionality for adding, viewing, and deleting items in a simple and efficient manner.
