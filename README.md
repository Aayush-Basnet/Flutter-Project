## 2. ListBook
The "ListBook" app is a simple task management application built using Flutter. It allows users to create a list of tasks or items that they need to remember or complete. The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing the list.

Add and Display Items: Users can add new items to the list by tapping on the floating action button (the "+" icon). The entered items are displayed in a scrollable list view.

Delete Items: Each item in the list can be deleted by swiping it horizontally from right to left. A delete icon is revealed, and upon confirmation, the item is removed from the list.

Overall, the "ListBook" app provides a convenient way to keep track of tasks or items that need to be remembered or completed. It offers basic functionality for adding, viewing, and deleting items in a simple and efficient manner.

## 3. Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic and popular two-player game built using Flutter. It provides an interactive and engaging experience for players to compete against each other in a grid-based game board.
Game Board: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, representing the positions where players can place their moves.

Player Icons: The game supports two players, represented by different icons. One player uses a circle icon, while the other uses a cross icon. These icons are visually displayed on the game board.

Turn-Based Gameplay: The game follows a turn-based approach, allowing players to take turns placing their moves on the board.

Player Indication: The game indicates the current player's turn, displaying a message at the top of the screen. It dynamically updates to show which player's turn it is.

Valid Moves: Players can only place their moves in empty positions on the game board. The game ensures that players can't override each other's moves.
Win Detection: The game implements win detection logic to determine the winner. It checks for three consecutive identical icons in a row, column, or diagonal. When a player wins, a message is displayed indicating the winner.

Draw Detection: If all positions on the game board are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.

Resetting the Game: After the game ends (win or draw), players have the option to reset the game and start a new round.
